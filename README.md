# RASPy


## [Blog](https://srush.github.io/raspy/)


This repo is a reimplementation for [RASP](https://github.com/tech-srl/RASP) as really neat language for thinking about transformer calculations.

This version is done completely in Python as an [embedded domain specific language](http://wiki.c2.com/?EmbeddedDomainSpecificLanguage).
